Please note that the following schema does not have ```SenderId``` and ```Substitutions```.  ```SenderId``` is not used in the US.  ```Substitutions``` is needed only to dynamically replace text in the message.

```
{
  "Addresses": {
    "+1<<Customer US Phone Number>>": {
      "ChannelType": "SMS"
    }
  },
  "MessageConfiguration": {
    "SMSMessage": {
      "Body": "SMS-Body-1-from ..",
      "Keyword": "<<Pinpoint Keyword>>",
      "MessageType": "TRANSACTIONAL",
      "OriginationNumber": "+1<<Pinpoint US Phone Number>>"
    }
  }
}
